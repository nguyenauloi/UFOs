# UFOs
Module 11

## **Project Overview**

Dana, a data journalist, is given the opportunity to write about one of her favorite topics: UFO sightings. Dana wants to build a website to display the UFO sightings for others to be able to navigate all the sightings.

To accomplish this, Dana will have to use the UFO sightings stored in the JavaScript array and present it as a table on her website. Dana will customize her website with bootstrap and include filters for each of the data types. These filters must be presented in a way that the user can easily identify how to interact with it.

The website includes filters for date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. Users can enter their desired search term in the appropriate box on the left

They can also use more than one search term to filter.

## Summary

The biggest drawback of this website is that there are a lot of assumptions, especially about the user. The filter is set up in a way that assumes the use knows what they want to search for. For example, they know what state(s) they want to look up, but it's possible there are no results from that state. The resulting table will just be empty, rather than informing the user there is no results or, better yet, how many results from any given search. Another idea would be to include a dropdown menu instead to help streamline the user's process. Finally, an explanation of shapes and possible FAQs about the comments would be useful as well.
